### Practices to use:

1. Set the viewport / scale
2. Use fluid widths as oppose to fixed (using max-width instead of width).
3. Media queries - Different CSS Styling for different screen sizes (Allow us to specify specific css styling based on screen size) .
4. Rem units over px (keep size intact with the rest of the page because rem units uses a multiplier of whatever the root html element font size is).
5. Mobile first method/strategy: Youfirst design your web page/site for mobile devices (small screens and then add your media queries for larger screens)
